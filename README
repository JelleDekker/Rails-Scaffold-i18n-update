The standard Scaffold feature in Rails produces quite a few hardcoded (English) text, especially in headers and links. These files provide a simple change to change this hardcoded text to i18n variables. It's a quick hack I thought might be useful to others looking for similar, better solutions are more than welcome...

Made to work with Rails 3.2.1

To use: place the scaffold folder in 'lib/templates/erb/' in your Rails project.  
Then add these variables to your localisation files:
scaffoldi18n:
  edit: Edit
  show: Show
  destroy: Delete
  new: New
  back: Back
  edit: Edit
  are_you_sure?: "Are you sure?"

The files than take the names for model/columns etc from your values in:
activerecord: 
  attributes: 
    column1: 'some name'
    column2: 'some name'
  models:
    model1: 'some name'
    model2: 'some name'
